  <p>Green Beans Not Walgreens</p>
  <p>My neighborhood is sandwiched between a massive graveyard and the largest park in Brooklyn. The greenery leads to many unwanted animals wandering around Windsor Terrace. I find that it is often under appreciated. </p>
  <p>At the center of the neighborhood is the old supermarket building. Located only two blocks away from my house, I’d always seen people go in to buy their groceries. The convenience was always key for my family. Between the fact that it was so close to my home and that it had a parking lot in Brooklyn, it was a rare treasure for my family. We didn’t go there often but when we needed eggs or milk we would run to the old supermarket. I didn’t realize it at the time, but the building served as a center for my neighborhood. It had low neighborhood prices with a middle class feel, the very definition of Windsor Terrace circa 2010. </p>
  <p>There was one more defining feature of this building: a parking lot.  If you know anything about Brooklyn real estate you know that a parking lot is nearly impossible to find. Not only does this building have a parking lot. But it has extra spaces at all times, a rare compaonity in New York. </p>
  <p>I remember getting weekly coupon magazines delivered to my door for the supermarket. Whenever I would go with my parents, I remember seeing most of my neighbors, and it just felt very “Windsor Terrace.” I don't really know how to describe it, but the heart of the neighborhood was really the supermarket.</p>
  <p>One day, I noticed a sign in one of my neighbor’s windows, “Green Beans not Walgreens.” I was confused as to what it meant, so I asked my mother. She said, “People are upset that they are closing the supermarket by our house. Many people in the area don’t have cars and would therefore have to travel far for groceries.” I thought to myself, “That makes sense. People shouldn’t have to travel far for food.” The construction of the new Walgreens halted since it was so widely rejected by community members. For two or three years I remember the corner being vacant. It was always weird to me; I thought that at least a Walgreens would be better than nothing. But still for those three years, the corner and parking lot was nothing but emptiness. Finally, the community and Walgreens reached a compromise. The property would be split and a supermarket would now be a third of the original size, and the Walgreens would occupy the rest of the property.</p>
  <p> Once the Walgreens opened, it became a regular part of my community's shopping routines. We used the pharmacy, and it always seemed like there was something on our shopping list for Walgreens. Once a year my mom would host her employees for dinner in our backyard. I remember never really loving these dinners, and always having to talk to her work associates. However in the fall of 2014, my four year old brother and I had a brilliant idea: we should make a PowerPoint presentation on why he loves Walgreens. While looking back I know this sounds ridiculous, but at the time this thing seemed very sensible. I remember teaching my brother how to use transitions, to add text with different colors, and coaching him on how to make a clear presentation. I had the brilliant idea that instead of just presenting to my parents, we would present to my mom's employees as well. So, he took the computer outside, said “Excuse me everybody I have a presentation,” and went on to give a well detailed and researched presentation on why he should go to Walgreens. I remember looking into the faces of all of my mom's employees, and thinking they were very interested in the presentation. In retrospect, they were probably trying very hard not to laugh at the ridiculousness of this situation. I remember being very proud of my brother for speaking super clearly and getting his point across. In the end, I believe his presentation was successful due to the fact that the next day my mother brought him to Walgreens to get a $5 treat. I remember him being filled with joy just at the thought of  being able to go to his favorite place. </p>
  <p>Most people think of New York as being famous for the Statue of Liberty or Times Square, but having grown up in a quiet Brooklyn neighborhood, I think the corner of tenth and prospect is the center of New York.
